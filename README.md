Iris is a Triton-based framework for Remote Memory Access (RMA) operations. Iris provides SHMEM-like APIs within Triton for Multi-GPU programming. Iris' goal is to make Multi-GPU programming a first-class citizen in Triton while retaining Triton's programmability and performance.

## Key Features

- **SHMEM-like RMA**: Iris provides SHMEM-like RMA support in Triton.
- **Simple and Intuitive API**: Iris provides simple and intuitive RMA APIs. Writing multi-GPU programs is as easy as writing single-GPU programs.
- **Triton-based**: Iris is built on top of Triton and inherits Triton's performance and capabilities.

## API Example

Here's a simple example showing how to perform remote memory operations between GPUs using Iris:

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
import triton
import triton.language as tl
import iris

# Device-side APIs
@triton.jit
def kernel(buffer, buffer_size: tl.constexpr, block_size: tl.constexpr, heap_bases_ptr):
    # Compute start index of this block
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    block_start = pid * block_size
    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, block_size)

    # Guard for out-of-bounds accesses
    mask = offsets < buffer_size

    # Store 1 in the target buffer at each offset
    source_rank = 0
    target_rank = 1
    iris.store(buffer + offsets, 1,
            source_rank, target_rank,
            heap_bases_ptr, mask=mask)

def _worker(rank, world_size):
    # Torch distributed initialization
    device_id = rank % torch.cuda.device_count()
    dist.init_process_group(
        backend="nccl",
        rank=rank,
        world_size=world_size,
        init_method="tcp://127.0.0.1:29500",
        device_id=torch.device(f"cuda:{device_id}")
    )

    # Iris initialization
    heap_size = 2**30   # 1GiB symmetric heap for inter-GPU communication
    iris_ctx = iris.iris(heap_size)
    cur_rank = iris_ctx.get_rank()

    # Iris tensor allocation
    buffer_size = 4096  # 4K elements buffer
    buffer = iris_ctx.zeros(buffer_size, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float32)

    # Launch the kernel on rank 0
    block_size = 1024
    grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(buffer_size, meta["block_size"]),)
    source_rank = 0
    if cur_rank == source_rank:
        kernel[grid](
            buffer,
            buffer_size,
            block_size,
            iris_ctx.get_heap_bases(),
        )

    # Synchronize all ranks
    iris_ctx.barrier()
    dist.destroy_process_group()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = 2  # Using two ranks
    mp.spawn(_worker, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size, join=True)
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Quick Installation

> [!NOTE]
> **Requirements**: Python 3.10+, PyTorch 2.0+ (ROCm version), ROCm 6.3.1+ HIP runtime, and Triton

For a quick installation directly from the repository:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/ROCm/iris.git
```

### Docker Compose (Recommended for Development)

The recommended way to get started is using Docker Compose, which provides a development environment with the Iris directory mounted inside the container. This allows you to make changes to the code outside the container and see them reflected inside.

```shell
# Start the development container
docker compose up --build -d

# or depending on your docker version
docker-compose up --build -d

# Attach to the running container
docker attach iris-dev

# Install Iris in development mode
cd iris && pip install -e .
```

For baremetal install, Docker or Apptainer setup, see [Installation](https://rocm.github.io/iris/getting-started/installation.html).

## Next Steps

Check out our [examples](examples/) directory for ready-to-run scripts and usage patterns, including peer-to-peer communication and GEMM benchmarks.

## Supported GPUs

Iris currently supports:

- MI300X, MI350X & MI355X

> [!NOTE]
> Iris may work on other AMD GPUs with ROCm compatibility.

## Roadmap

We plan to extend Iris with the following features:

- **Extended GPU Support**: Testing and optimization for other AMD GPUs.
- **RDMA Support**: Multi-node support using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) for distributed computing across multiple machines.
- **End-to-End Integration**: Comprehensive examples covering various use cases and end-to-end patterns.
